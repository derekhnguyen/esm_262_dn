Why am I taking this course?
- I am taking this course so that I can continue to strengthen my programming skills. I also hope that this class offers real world environmental applications that I can translate directly to my professional work. I am also taking this class so that I have more personal data and code to refer to make sure I remember the coding skills I will learn in this class.


Describe your data science background....
- I have taken Allison Horst's 206 class and currently enrolled in her Advanced data analysis course this quarter as well. Other than that, I do not have any other prior data science experience.
